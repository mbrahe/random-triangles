Random triangle art in pico-8

Uses a super simple super slow recursive algorithm to draw a bunch of colored triangles. This is very fun to look at! It's even more fun than watching triangles instaneously appear. Maybe seeing each triangle slowly assemble builds some emotional attachment in your mind as you stare at them? Try it out!
